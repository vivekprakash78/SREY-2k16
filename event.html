			<h2>Robo Cubix </h2>
			<pre>
It is a Manual Robotics event in which participants are needed to build manually controlled bot which is capable of fighting against another bot for the maximum number of points. The objective of this event is not to immobilize your opponent’s bot or push it out of the arena but you have to fight for your area and score some points by performing some tasks. This event is not like conventional Robo-War type. It is planned in such a way that all the teams have to play strategically. It may not happen that the strongest bot will win. You have to play a strategic match. There will be two teams playing against each other. The team who will score maximum points will be the winner.

GENERAL RULES
•	250 is the registration fees for each team. 

•	The maximum number of participants allowed per team is 4. 

•	Teams are required to bring their own power supply to drive the bot. Only one plug point of 220V, 50Hz supply will be provided to each team. DC-DC converter is not allowed.

•	 Power supply : Maximum voltage up to 18 volt and maximum current up to 5 Amp.

•	Dimensions of the bot : 25cm * 25cm

•	Weight of the bot should be less than 4kg.

•	The first round will be a timer round.

•	From the second round the match will be held against each other.

•	There will be some objects in the arena which will carry some points. The bots will move those objects in a specified area and defend them from being stolen by the opponent. 

•	No bot is allowed to pick those objects up or grip them or incorporate the objects within its body. 

•	There will be a specific time limit for each match. 

•	Use of Lego Kits or any readymade mechanisms are NOT allowed. 

•	Any kind of mechanism which may damage the arena e.g. Flame, Acid, Hammer etc are NOT permitted. Any serious damage to the arena may lead to disqualification. 

•	Participants are not permitted to touch the bot while the match is running. If any such situation occurs where the bot is required to be operated by hand then the coordinators will take necessary steps. 

•	Participants are requested to bring their own tools and spare parts if required. 

•	The decision of the coordinators will be final.
